There are many projects in the Lingua Pupuli organization.
This repository holds a record of how we prefer to do things and common practices.

## Goals

### As much as possible adhere to the four values of agile

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools;
* Working software over comprehensive documentation;
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation; and
* Responding to change over following a plan.

### Changing practices

We continually evaluate our processes to make sure they fit.
Expect them to change and evolve over time

## Practices

* [Project Management](project-management/README.md)
